# go-check, a Simple Health Checker Written in Go

This command-line tool allows you to quickly and easily check the current status of a website on a port-by-port level. Simply specify the domain name and port you would like to check (if not specified, the port will default to `80`), and the tool will provide a response which contains the current status of the provided domain, the IP address of the domain, and the IP address of the computer sending the request.

I started this project as an introduction to programming in Go, and as such, it is very simple. Nonetheless, it can be a useful tool to include in your arsenal, and takes up very little disk space.
